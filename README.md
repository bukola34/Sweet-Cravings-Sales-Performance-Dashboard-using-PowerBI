# Sweet-Cravings-Sales-Performance-Dashboard-using-PowerBI
Power BI case study analyzing 16 months of sales data to uncover customer insights, product performance, and progress toward a $5M profit target.

# Project Insights – Sweet-Cravings Bakery Dashboard

Strong Profitability: Achieved $1.28M in revenue with $767.9K in profit (≈60% margin), reflecting efficient cost control with expenses of $511.9K.

Customer Concentration Risk: Wholesome is the leading customer, but reliance on a few major buyers poses risks. Diversification of customer base is critical to resilience.

Single Product Dependency: Sales are driven entirely by Chocolate Chip cookies (255.99K units, 151 orders). Lack of product variety exposes the bakery to demand shifts and limits growth potential.

Seasonal Demand Patterns: Profit peaks in October and December (holiday-driven sales) while February and November show dips. Seasonality presents both risk and opportunity for targeted campaigns.

Growth Benchmark: Current performance is far below the $5M target, indicating the need for expansion strategies across product lines, customers, and markets.

# Recommendations

Product Diversification – Introduce new cookie varieties and seasonal flavors to expand revenue streams.

Customer Base Expansion – Reduce dependency on Wholesome by targeting new retail/wholesale clients and strengthening direct-to-consumer channels.

Leverage Seasonality – Maximize holiday demand with limited-edition products, bundles, and promotions. Use marketing campaigns to boost sales in low-demand months.

Strategic Reinvestment – Allocate profits toward scaling production, improving distribution, and marketing to drive long-term growth.

Cost & Risk Monitoring – Continue controlling expenses while monitoring risks from supplier/customer concentration.

# Overall Story:
Sweet-Cravings Bakery has proven its profitability with one product line, but sustainable growth toward its $5M target requires diversification, expansion, and strategic reinvestment. This dashboard illustrates how data storytelling can surface risks and opportunities in a clear, actionable way.
